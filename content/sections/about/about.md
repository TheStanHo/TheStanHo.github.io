Around four years ago, I started my career in DevOps. Initially, I joined a Healthcare company as an IT graduate and expressed interest in working with a colleague who was solely responsible for deploying cloud resources. This led to the formation of the DevOps team. The company provides healthcare solutions and during the Covid pandemic, the UK government needed a software solution to register vaccinations. I was involved in a project to deploy and monitor this system called <a href="https://www.graphnethealth.com/solutions/vaccinations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u>NIMs - National Immunisation Management System</u></a>. 

After completing this project, I was ready for a new challenge and decided to join <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u>Frontiers</u></a>, a publishing company dedicated to making science accessible to all and have been working for them since. Since joining, I have implemented monitoring and alerting solutions that allow us to be proactive rather than reactive to issues. Additionally, I have worked on improving performance through the use of Azure networking technologies, such as Frontdoor and CDNs. Throughout my time at Frontiers, I have built strong relationships with various development teams, helping them implement solutions and troubleshoot their applications effectively.

My passion for technology, problem-solving, and continuous learning has driven my career in DevOps, where I can combine these interests to create impactful solutions for others.
