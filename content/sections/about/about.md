Around three years ago, I started my career in DevOps. Initially, I joined the company as an IT graduate and expressed interest in working with a colleague who was solely responsible for deploying cloud resources. This led to the formation of the DevOps team. The company provides healthcare solutions and during the Covid pandemic, the UK government needed a software solution to register vaccinations. I was involved in a project to deploy and monitor this system called <a href="https://www.graphnethealth.com/solutions/vaccinations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="External Link"><u>NIMs - National Immunisation Management System</u></a>. 

After completing this project, I was ready for a new challenge and decided to join Frontiers, a publishing company dedicated to making science accessible to all.

I have always been passionate about technology, problem-solving, and learning, and working in DevOps allows me to combine these interests to benefit others in my career.
